  "content": "<p>For too long, airline systems have been built around internal processes rather than customer needs. The customer-first revolution is changing this, putting the traveller at the centre of everything.</p>\n\n<h2>The Old Way: PNR-Centric Systems</h2>\n<p>Traditional airline systems organise everything around the Passenger Name Record (PNR)—a booking-centric approach that made sense when most customers made a single reservation and never looked back. But today's travellers expect more flexibility and control.</p>\n\n<h2>The New Way: Customer-Centric Systems</h2>\n<p>Modern platforms like Retailaer organise data around the customer, not the booking. This fundamental shift enables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent customer profiles across all interactions</li>\n<li>Personalised offers based on history and preferences</li>\n<li>Seamless management of multiple bookings</li>\n<li>Flexible modifications and upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Real Business Impact</h2>\n<p>Customer-first isn't just a buzzword—it drives measurable business results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher conversion rates from personalised offers</li>\n<li>Increased customer lifetime value</li>\n<li>Reduced customer service costs</li>\n<li>Improved brand loyalty and reputation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Making the Transition</h2>\n<p>Moving to a customer-first approach doesn't require ripping out existing systems. Modern platforms can integrate with legacy infrastructure while providing new customer-centric capabilities on top.</p>\n\n<p>The airlines that embrace this shift will be the ones that thrive in the next decade of travel retailing.</p>"
