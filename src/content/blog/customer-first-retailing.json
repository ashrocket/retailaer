Now try booking a flight from Frankfurt to Berlin—and suddenly you're navigating a labyrinth of fare classes, restrictions, and legacy systems that haven't changed since the 1970s.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pullquote\">The gap between what customers expect and what airlines deliver has never been wider.</div>\n\n<h2>A Tale of Two Experiences</h2>\n\n<p>Consider this contrast: When you order dinner through an app, the system knows your preferences, suggests your favourites, handles payment seamlessly, and lets you track your order in real-time. The experience is built entirely around <em>you</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But when you book a flight? The system doesn't know you—it knows your <strong>PNR</strong>. A cryptic 6-character code becomes your identity. Want to change something? Navigate the maze. Want to add a bag? Start over. Want to see all your bookings in one place? Good luck.</p>\n\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<h4>The Reality Gap</h4>\n<p>Food delivery apps achieve <strong>85%+ customer satisfaction</strong>. Airline booking experiences average just <strong>62%</strong>. The technology to close this gap exists today—the question is whether airlines will embrace it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>The Old Way: PNR-Centric Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional airline systems organise everything around the Passenger Name Record (PNR)—a booking-centric approach designed in an era of paper tickets and travel agents.</p>\n\n<div class=\"features-list\">\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✗</span> Each booking is an isolated transaction</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✗</span> Customer history is fragmented or lost</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✗</span> Modifications require starting from scratch</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✗</span> Personalisation is nearly impossible</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>The New Way: Customer-Centric Systems</h2>\n\n<p>Modern platforms organise data around the <strong>customer</strong>, not the booking. This fundamental shift changes everything:</p>\n\n<div class=\"strategy-grid\">\n<div class=\"strategy-card\">\n<h3>Persistent Profiles</h3>\n<p>Every interaction builds a richer understanding of each customer's preferences and needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"strategy-card\">\n<h3>Personalised Offers</h3>\n<p>Relevant recommendations based on actual history, not generic upsells.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"strategy-card\">\n<h3>Unified View</h3>\n<p>All bookings, preferences, and loyalty data in one seamless experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"strategy-card\">\n<h3>Flexible Journeys</h3>\n<p>Easy modifications, upgrades, and changes without the maze.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pullquote\">When you put the customer at the centre, revenue follows. Not despite the focus on experience—because of it.</div>\n\n<h2>Real Business Impact</h2>\n\n<p>Customer-first isn't just a buzzword—it drives measurable results:</p>\n\n<div class=\"features-list\">\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✓</span> Higher conversion rates from personalised, relevant offers</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✓</span> Increased customer lifetime value through better retention</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✓</span> Reduced service costs as customers self-manage easily</div>\n<div class=\"feature\"><span class=\"check\">✓</span> Stronger brand loyalty in a commoditised market</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Making the Transition</h2>\n\n<p>The good news: moving to a customer-first approach doesn't require ripping out existing systems. Modern platforms integrate with legacy infrastructure while providing new customer-centric capabilities on top.</p>\n\n<p>The airlines that embrace this shift will be the ones that thrive. The ones that don't? They'll keep wondering why their customers feel like they're hiking through a labyrinth just to buy a simple ticket.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cta-box\">\n<h3>Ready to Put Customers First?</h3>\n<p>See how Retailaer helps airlines transform from PNR-centric to customer-centric retailing.</p>\n<a href=\"/contact\" class=\"btn\">Get in Touch</a>\n</div>"
