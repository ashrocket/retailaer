Her pragmatic, real-world perspective cuts through the theoretical frameworks to show what actually works.</p>\n\n<h2>The Core Question</h2>\n<p><strong>\"Why do airlines still struggle with order management when eCommerce mastered it years ago?\"</strong></p>\n\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Legacy PNR systems and outdated protocols hinder adoption</li>\n<li>Growing divide between traditional airline processes and digital retailing capabilities</li>\n<li>NDC alone doesn't constitute true personalization or retailing capability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What Modern OMS Enables</h2>\n<p>An OMS \"syncs up inventory, customer accounts, and logistics in real time\" without holding inventory itself. Modern retailing requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business rules engines</li>\n<li>Orchestration capabilities</li>\n<li>Integration flexibility</li>\n<li>Data capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Path Forward</h2>\n<p>Order-based PSS provides a modernization foundation, and solutions like Retailaer's OMS demonstrate what's possible atop existing systems. The industry consensus: airlines must adopt e-commerce thinking while acknowledging industry-specific challenges.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anncederhall_order-management-in-airline-retailing-activity-7387400130905174016-XrrY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full post on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
