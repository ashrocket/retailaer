Ann Cederhall's wish list isn't revolutionary—as she points out, these are \"basic user-centric design principles travelers expect from every other industry.\" The gap between airline self-perception and customer reality is precisely what modern offer and order management can solve.</p>\n\n<h2>The Disconnect</h2>\n<p>Ann cites research showing 75% of companies believe they're customer-centric, yet only 30% of customers agree. This disconnect is especially pronounced in airlines.</p>\n\n<h2>The 15 Wishes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent Flyer Validation:</strong> Allow validation of FF numbers before booking to see point earnings potential</li>\n<li><strong>Immediate Point Credits:</strong> Provide instant post-flight point accrual notifications</li>\n<li><strong>Group Seating Management:</strong> Enable adding colleagues and family to reservations for coordinated seating</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-Flight Menu Access:</strong> Display onboard menus and sales options in the airline app prior to departure</li>\n<li><strong>Partner Airline Services:</strong> Extend all purchasable offerings to codeshare partner bookings</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Cancellation Products:</strong> Offer straightforward \"cancel for any reason\" options</li>\n<li><strong>Waitlist Upgrades:</strong> Allow paid access to earlier flight waitlists</li>\n<li><strong>Swift Refunds:</strong> Process refunds quickly; credit digital wallets for small amounts</li>\n<li><strong>Travel Agent Integration:</strong> Seamlessly connect airline and travel seller app experiences</li>\n<li><strong>Broad Compatibility:</strong> Eliminate \"airline website only\" restrictions</li>\n<li><strong>Airport Experience Intelligence:</strong> Send pre-arrival messages with real-time info</li>\n<li><strong>Baggage Transparency:</strong> Offer smart tracker options and online baggage issue reporting</li>\n<li><strong>Personalized Disruption Support:</strong> Provide actionable alternatives during delays/cancellations</li>\n<li><strong>Group Travel Flexibility:</strong> Remove arbitrary nine-passenger group booking thresholds</li>\n<li><strong>Destination Inspiration:</strong> Create wish-list features for travel aspiration curation</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These aren't pie-in-the-sky demands. They're table stakes in 2025.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-15-bullet-point-wish-list-better-customer-when-flying-cederhall-oxzaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
