This piece is a must-read for anyone about to sign a vendor contract.</p>\n\n<h2>The Problem with \"We Must Do NDC\"</h2>\n<p>Ann critiques the airline industry's tendency to pursue NDC, retail strategies, and modern PSS systems without clear strategic reasoning. \"We must do NDC\" has become an industry mantra lacking substance. As she puts it: \"NDC is just a standard and is not going to help you to Retail\" without accompanying strategic transformation.</p>\n\n<h2>The First Question</h2>\n<p>Before any technology decision, airlines must ask: <strong>\"Do you know what your customers want?\"</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Key Strategic Questions</h2>\n\n<h3>On Content Strategy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers want added value: cancellation flexibility, change policies</li>\n<li>Dynamic bundling with discounts appeals to passengers</li>\n<li>Ancillary products (eSIMs, food, electronic bag tags) enhance travel</li>\n<li>Travelers expect recognition across multi-leg journeys despite PNR splits</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>On Customer Experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicate through preferred customer channels</li>\n<li>Implement efficient IROP systems</li>\n<li>Enable quick refunds</li>\n<li>Offer flights on partner airlines</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>On Distribution Cost Reduction</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernize outdated financial models</li>\n<li>Grow direct sales through incentives</li>\n<li>Address rising PSS costs and plan alternatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ann's advice: \"Talk to many different people\" and develop substantive answers to \"Why NDC,\" \"Why Retail,\" and \"Why replace the PSS?\" before implementing these initiatives. Strategic clarity precedes technological adoption.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/elevator-pitch-distribution-ann-cederhall-qicyf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
