  "content": "<p>Clearly understanding the role of these systems can greatly help airlines improve their ability to retail. Let me explain how a strong connection between an OMS and PSS can help streamline the airline order fulfilment process and grow customer loyalty.</p>\n\n<h2>What is an OMS?</h2>\n<p>The OMS provides airline retailers with a centralised hub for managing Offers and Orders across channels. It captures Orders from multiple sales channels, connects with airline partners, and then connects to other internal platforms.</p>\n\n<h3>OMS Benefits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensures accurate order tracking throughout the order lifecycle</li>\n<li>Enables omnichannel scalability</li>\n<li>Improves customer satisfaction through precise delivery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What is a PSS?</h2>\n<p>A PSS manages airline operations, inventory, and passenger records including PNRs, e-tickets, and EMDs. It maintains rigorous security and operational procedures.</p>\n\n<h3>PSS Benefits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensures high safety, punctuality, and reliability standards</li>\n<li>Provides inventory visibility</li>\n<li>Manages partner airline access</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How They Work Together</h2>\n<p>Implementing an OMS on top of a PSS allows airlines to secure operations while unlocking commercial opportunities. The OMS reduces the dependency on the PSS and allows airlines to retail with the ability to innovate and experiment.</p>\n\n<p>You can literally introduce new products in hours. The OMS enables you to sell any content you wish to retail and control your channels.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the OMS as the 'orchestrator' coordinating commercial applications, while the PSS manages essential operational machinery. Together, they enable airlines to deliver modern retail experiences without sacrificing operational integrity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/oms-pss-how-does-systems-work-together-retailaer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continue Reading on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
