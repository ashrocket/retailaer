  "content": "<p>The Passenger Name Record has been the foundation of airline systems for decades. But as customer expectations evolve and technology advances, it's time to think beyond the PNR.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding the PNR's Limitations</h2>\n<p>PNRs were designed for a different era:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One booking per customer per trip</li>\n<li>Limited modification capabilities</li>\n<li>No persistent customer relationship</li>\n<li>Siloed data across different systems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Order Management Alternative</h2>\n<p>Modern order management systems treat each purchase as part of an ongoing customer relationship rather than an isolated transaction. This enables:</p>\n\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>Customers can easily modify, split, combine, or transfer orders without creating new bookings.</p>\n\n<h3>Visibility</h3>\n<p>All customer interactions are visible in one place, enabling better service and personalisation.</p>\n\n<h3>Continuity</h3>\n<p>The relationship persists beyond individual transactions, enabling long-term engagement.</p>\n\n<h2>Real-World Benefits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced customer service workload</li>\n<li>More flexible change and cancellation policies</li>\n<li>Better data for personalisation</li>\n<li>Easier integration with partner systems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Path Forward</h2>\n<p>You don't have to abandon PNRs overnight. The smart approach is to layer modern order management on top of existing systems, gradually expanding capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>With 204 million orders processed, Retailaer has proven that this approach works at scale—delivering the flexibility customers demand while maintaining the reliability airlines require.</p>"
