This post is essential reading for any airline evaluating their technology options—the distinctions she draws between standalone OMS, order-based PSS, and hybrid solutions will save you from costly misunderstandings.</p>\n\n<h2>Three Approaches to Modernization</h2>\n<p>Ann demystifies the differences between three approaches to modernizing airline distribution systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standalone OMS:</strong> Functions as a \"multi-tool\" overlay sitting above any PSS</li>\n<li><strong>Order-based PSS:</strong> Platforms with built-in retail capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid solutions:</strong> Cannot operate independently from their parent PSS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What Orders Actually Enable</h2>\n<p>The real power of order structures is that they enable airlines to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine customers with different itineraries</li>\n<li>Create flexible service bundles</li>\n<li>Apply dynamic discounts</li>\n<li>Finally realize shopping basket functionality—rather than mere transaction processing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Right Questions to Ask</h2>\n<p>Ann recommends airlines assess whether systems support flexible customer combinations, dynamic discounting, real bundling capabilities, and actual retail transformation—rather than pursuing technology for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The technology selected matters less than whether it genuinely enables the \"4 Cs\"—increased sales, improved customer experience, cost reduction, and channel control.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anncederhall_ndc-offerandorder-one-activity-7396937822869516288-RGU4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full post on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
