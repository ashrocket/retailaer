This piece resonates deeply with Retailaer's customer-first philosophy—the idea that airlines should rethink legacy processes from the traveler's perspective, not just optimize existing systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Rethinking the Ticket</h2>\n<p>The pandemic exposed critical inefficiencies in airline systems—thousands of unused tickets, vouchers, and refund processing nightmares. Ticket reissuing processes remain expensive and cumbersome, with complex fare rules limiting operational flexibility.</p>\n\n<h2>A Pay-on-Delivery Model</h2>\n<p>Ann proposes adopting pay-on-delivery concepts inspired by retail innovations and blockchain technology:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers pay for reservations upfront</li>\n<li>Payment platforms hold funds until service delivery</li>\n<li>No tickets issued until check-in or departure</li>\n<li>Changes avoid costly reissues</li>\n<li>EMDs only issued when services are consumed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Benefits</h2>\n<p>This approach could dramatically reduce airline costs for refunds and reissues, simplify complaint handling, decrease the need for clearing houses and auditing, and—most importantly—improve the customer experience.</p>\n\n<p>Ann advocates for blockchain solutions like Chain4Travel/CAMINO to support this transformation without traditional payment intermediaries. Airlines transitioning from ticket/EMD systems to order-based models will have significant competitive advantages.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/isnt-time-customer-first-approach-airline-ticketing-ann-cederhall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article on LinkedIn →</a></p>"
