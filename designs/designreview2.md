Got it—here’s a punchy teardown and a concrete upgrade plan that hits your three goals: fresh look, visible trust, and clear expertise.

Snapshot: where retailaer stands now

Strengths
	•	Clear positioning (“Customer-First Offer & Order Management”) and simple nav.  ￼
	•	Solutions page already names key modules (Customer-First Offers, Distribution Control, Orders, NDC API, portals).  ￼

Gaps
	•	Trust signals: no customer logos, quotes, case studies, compliance language.
	•	Thought leadership: Insights page is a placeholder (“Blog is currently developing”).  ￼
	•	Proof: great stats (“5M+ orders”, “300+ capabilities”) appear, but without context or references.  ￼

What to emulate (and avoid)

Emulate
	•	Stripe: ultraclean hero, contrasty typography, modular “building blocks” + crisp API docs links = instant credibility. (Use Stripe’s IA pattern: Problem → Capabilities → Proof → Integrations → Resources.)  ￼
	•	Arcube: one-line value prop, social proof (partner logos), and “launch in days” speed claim placed above the fold.  ￼

Avoid
	•	Revolut: visually loud marketing fluff; don’t bury product signals under lifestyle gloss.  ￼
	•	Accelya / Datalex / OpenJaw: buzzword-heavy copy and vague tables; hard to grasp product edges fast. Your “compare” block should be specific and scannable, not generic.  ￼

Home page: proposed wireframe (content & order)
	1.	Hero (2-sentence)

	•	H1: Offer & Order Management built for airline retailing
	•	Sub: Launch NDC-capable offers, manage orders end-to-end, and reduce PSS dependency—without a multi-year migration.
	•	Primary CTA: Book a demo  | Secondary: See architecture

	2.	Immediate proof strip

	•	“5M+ orders processed” • “12 years building Offer/Order” • “300+ capabilities” (link each metric to proof pages).  ￼

	3.	Logos + testimonial

	•	“Trusted by” row (start with Air Europa; add “in evaluation with …” if needed).
	•	Pull-quote (1–2 lines) from Air Europa news item; link to article.  ￼

	4.	What it does (3 cards)

	•	Offers (dynamic pricing/bundling, partners/ancillaries)
	•	Orders (order-centric servicing, PNR sync)  ￼
	•	Distribution (channels, agency/corporate, NDC API)  ￼

	5.	Why it’s different (vs. PSS & “super-PNR”)

	•	A tight, data-driven compare (not a generic matrix). Use 6 specific rows: Time to first sale; PNR/Order sync; Ancillary marketplace; Dynamic bundling; Agency portal depth; Total cost to integrate. Replace the current broad table.  ￼

	6.	Architecture overview

	•	Small diagram: Channels → Offer Engine → Order Manager → Payments → Integrations (PSS optional) with an “NDC Capable API” callout. (You already mention NDC; visualize it.)  ￼

	7.	Compliance & transparency

	•	Badges/claims with links: IATA NDC capable, PII controls & data residency statement, SOC 2 roadmap (publish the roadmap page), AWS region options. (Accelya prominently touts AWS—do it but briefly and factually.)  ￼

	8.	Resources

	•	“Deep dives”: Offer modeling, Order servicing & PNR sync, Partner marketplace, Price adjustment rules—each as a 3–5 minute read with one diagram and one code/object schema snippet.  ￼

	9.	Final CTA

	•	“See a 12-minute product tour” (loom link) + “Request a sandbox”

Solutions page: tighten & productize
	•	Convert the long scroller into 4 product tiles: Offer Engine, Order Manager, Distribution & Portals, Payments & Settlement—each with 3 bullet capabilities and a “How it works” diagram. Current content maps cleanly to these tiles but needs structure and typos cleaned (e.g., Messege → Message, cabilities → capabilities).  ￼
	•	Add NDC API section with a one-screen schema teaser (Offer, Order, Ancillary objects) + example request/response.  ￼

Trust engine (what to add next)
	•	Case study #1: Air Europa NDC uplift — 400–600 words, single KPI (time-to-first-sale or attach-rate) + architecture diagram. Link to the external FTE note as third-party validation.  ￼
	•	“Numbers with receipts” page that substantiates 5M orders / 12 years / 300 capabilities (even if partially anonymized).  ￼
	•	Leadership page with short bios and airline track record (“25+ airlines served”).  ￼
	•	Compliance & Security mini-site: data categories handled, encryption at-rest/in-transit, access controls, audit logging, incident response, and SOC2 timeline.

Thought-leadership plan (fast wins)
	•	Publish 3 pieces (500–900 words each) in 30 days:
	1.	Customer-First vs. Super-PNR: why order-centric alone isn’t enough (show your PNR sync stance).  ￼
	2.	Ancillary Marketplace in practice: partner APIs, pricing rules, fulfillment (you already reference Marketplace & Direct Connect).  ￼
	3.	Time-to-first-sale: shaving months off NDC launches (echo Arcube’s “days not months,” but with your own numbers and steps).  ￼
	•	Each article ends with: “Download the Offer/Order data model (PDF)” and “Request sandbox.”

Copy starters (use this tone)

Hero

Offer & Order Management built for airline retailing.
Launch NDC-capable offers, manage orders end-to-end, and cut PSS dependency—without a multi-year migration.

Differentiator blurb

Customer-First by design. We start from the traveler and work backward—so dynamic bundling, marketplace ancillaries, and order servicing feel native across every channel.  ￼

Proof panel

5M+ orders processed • 12 years building Offer/Order • 300+ capabilities (See how we count →)

Air Europa quote (placeholder)

“Retailaer accelerated our NDC program and unified ancillaries with flight retailing.” — Air Europa (link to article)  ￼

Visual & UX directives
	•	Stripe-like clarity: generous white space, max 2 fonts, high-contrast headings, short sentences, <60-char line length.  ￼
	•	Arcube-style immediacy: above-the-fold value + logos + speed claim.  ￼
	•	Component library: cards for capabilities, 2-column proof rows, sticky top nav with a single primary CTA.
	•	Kill the generic matrix: replace with a 6-row quantified compare (include “months vs. years,” “# of portals included,” “agency flows out-of-the-box”).  ￼

Page inventory (minimum viable site)
	•	Home, Products (4 tiles), Architecture, Customers (logos + 1–2 case studies), Pricing (contact sales + implementation tiers), Docs (API overview + schemas), Insights, Company, Security & Compliance, Contact.
