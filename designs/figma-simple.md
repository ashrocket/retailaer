## Step 4: Upload Images to Figma AI

1. **Current homepage screenshot** (from http://localhost:8000)
2. **Design brief image** (the text brief you created above)
3. **Reference images** (OPTIONAL - screenshots of sites like stripe.com, linear.app)

## Step 5: After Figma Generates

### Review the designs:
- ✓ All 5 pages created?
- ✓ Colors match (teal + amber)?
- ✓ Mobile responsive versions?
- ✓ Component library included?

### Refine if needed:
- "Make hero section bigger and bolder"
- "Add more whitespace between sections"
- "Make it more modern, less corporate"
- "Show dark mode version"

### Export from Figma:
- Logo (SVG)
- Icons (SVG set)
- Hero illustrations (SVG/PNG)
- Take screenshots of all pages
- Document colors, fonts, spacing

---

## Step 6: Share with Me

Once you have Figma designs:

1. **Share Figma link** (with view access)
2. **Export assets folder** - upload to `/assets/` in this repo
3. **Screenshot key pages** with measurements visible
4. **Document design specs**:
   - Color hex codes
   - Font names, sizes, weights
   - Spacing values

Then I'll code the complete site based on the designs!
