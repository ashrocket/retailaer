Third-Generation Offer & Order Management Platform Overview

Retailaer offers a modern airline retailing and distribution platform built around a third-generation Offer and Order Management System (OMS). Unlike first-generation PSS-based booking systems or second-generation eCommerce add-ons, Retailaer’s OMS is a “customer-first” solution engineered to handle Offers, Orders, Payments and more in one unified hub ￼. This platform was “designed differently” – it is flexible, adaptable, and scalable, allowing airlines (and other travel retailers) to focus on retailing while reducing reliance on legacy Passenger Service Systems (PSS) ￼. In practice, the Retailaer OMS serves as a centralised hub for managing offers and orders across all channels, decoupling commercial retail functions from the PSS. This third-generation approach empowers airlines to create, personalize, and fulfill travel offers with greater agility and without the limitations of traditional systems ￼ ￼.

Key Features and Capabilities
	•	Omnichannel Offer & Order Management: Retailaer’s platform supports every sales channel with a seamless experience – from consumer web and mobile apps to corporate and agency portals, call centers, and NDC/API connections ￼ ￼. All channels connect to a single Offer and Order Management hub, ensuring consistent, real-time retailing across direct and indirect touchpoints ￼.
	•	Personalized “Customer-First” Offers: The system leverages customer data and partner content to deliver tailored offers that suit each customer’s preferences ￼. Airlines can dynamically bundle flights, ancillaries (bags, seats, etc.), and third-party services into personalized packages ￼. This results in more relevant offers in every channel – effectively saying “goodbye to generic offers, hello to relevant offers” ￼.
	•	Integrated Ancillaries and Third-Party Products: Retailaer’s OMS natively integrates flights, airline ancillaries, and non-air products into one catalog ￼. A built-in Marketplace allows airlines to offer partner products or services that are not in the PSS (such as hotels, insurance, or duty-free items) without heavy IT “plumbing” ￼. The platform simply plugs into partners’ APIs so that “flight connections happen on the fly” for bundled interline journeys or ancillary content ￼.
	•	Advanced Pricing and Revenue Features: The solution includes tools for dynamic pricing and retail optimization. Airlines can set up simple business rules for price adjustments, and the system will automatically calculate the optimal price or promotion for flights and extras in real-time ￼. A Retail Optimiser module helps spotlight special offers and maximize revenue per customer ￼. Additionally, Retailaer supports multi-currency and loyalty point combinations at checkout, so customers can pay using mixed currencies or points seamlessly ￼. Gift card and voucher capabilities are also built in to boost loyalty and ancillary sales ￼.
	•	Order Management Outside the PSS: The platform’s Order Management is truly decoupled from legacy reservation systems. It captures and tracks all orders (including flights and add-ons) in the OMS itself, rather than relying on PNRs alone ￼ ￼. This means customer orders are centrally stored and can be serviced independently of the PSS, though Retailaer will synchronize orders with a PSS if one is in use ￼. By “breaking free” the commercial order data from the PSS, airlines gain freedom to extend offerings and fulfill orders that PSSs can’t traditionally handle ￼. It also lets airlines keep a history of customer orders virtually forever, powering better personalization and re-marketing based on a customer’s full purchase history ￼.
	•	Open, Modular Architecture: Retailaer’s third-gen eCommerce platform is built with an open API and modular components. It is IATA NDC-capable by design, allowing easy integration with distribution partners and channels via industry-standard XML/JSON APIs ￼. The modular approach also means Retailaer can integrate or coexist with other tech solutions. For example, the platform can incorporate PROS’s Group Sales Optimiser for group booking management and the IATA Financial Gateway for payments as part of a deployment ￼. This openness ensures airlines can plug in additional capabilities without being locked into a single vendor stack.
	•	Comprehensive Content & Profile Management: The solution comes with a Content Management module to maintain all product content, images, and copy in multiple languages, including a built-in Product Information Management system ￼. A Customer Profiles module centralizes each customer’s data and past orders across channels ￼. This unified customer view means the airline can identify customers “regardless of their current appearance” (identity across channels) and target them with the right offers at the right time ￼.
	•	Scalability and Speed-to-Market: Retailaer has invested in over “300 capabilities and 20,000 features” across 14 product categories within the platform ￼, ensuring out-of-the-box functionality for most retailing needs. Despite its breadth, the solution is designed for rapid implementation – measured in months, not years, unlike many traditional or second-gen systems ￼. This allows airlines to achieve quick speed-to-market with new retail offerings. As Retailaer’s CEO puts it, “the future of airline retailing lies in adaptability, agility, speed to market and true partner enablement” ￼.

Benefits for Airlines and Travel Retailers

Adopting Retailaer’s OMS brings tangible benefits to airlines, travel companies, and their customers:
	•	Enhanced Customer Experience: By tailoring content and offers to each customer, airlines can deliver an “exceptional customer experience” that boosts satisfaction and conversions ￼. The platform ensures accuracy and consistency in offers/orders across all touchpoints, which is critical since 92% of buyers will abandon a brand after a poor experience ￼ ￼. With Retailaer, customers enjoy a smooth, personalized shopping journey – whether they’re buying a simple flight or a dynamically packaged trip.
	•	Increased Revenue and Ancillary Sales: Retailaer enables airlines to diversify and bundle products in ways not previously possible. Its dynamic bundling and marketplace features allow packaging of flights with hotels, tours, insurance, and more, driving incremental revenue ￼. Airlines can easily spotlight upsell opportunities (seats, upgrades, loyalty offers, etc.) at the right moment via business rules and the Retail Optimiser ￼. This flexibility to create new offers translates into additional revenue streams and higher share of wallet per customer.
	•	Greater Distribution Control & Lower Costs: The platform gives airlines direct control of distribution. They can engage travelers via direct channels (website, mobile, etc.), agency portals, NDC connections, or even traditional GDS – all through one system ￼. By bringing more sales onto their own platform, airlines cut intermediary costs and can ensure “a seamless retail experience for everyone, knowing exactly who your customers are” ￼. Retailaer’s approach also identifies each customer across channels (through profiles), allowing the airline to recognize and serve the customer whether they book via the airline’s site or a travel agent ￼. This unified view helps reduce duplication and dependency on third-party systems.
	•	Reduced Reliance on Legacy Systems: Because the OMS is independent of the PSS for commercial functions, airlines can innovate rapidly without waiting on PSS enhancements. New products or partnerships can be onboarded via APIs, and offers can be adjusted with business rules in the OMS, sidestepping the constraints of legacy “filed fares” or rigid booking codes ￼ ￼. Importantly, PSS outages or limitations won’t halt retailing – the OMS holds offer/order data and can sync back to the PSS as needed ￼. This resilience and decoupling from legacy infrastructure are key to what makes Retailaer a third-generation platform.
	•	Improved Order Lifecycle Management: The OMS approach tracks the entire lifecycle of an order – from initial offer creation and conversion to post-booking servicing. Customers can manage their orders (changes, cancellations, additions) through self-service portals or apps powered by Retailaer ￼. This customer-centric order servicing not only boosts satisfaction (giving customers more control over their bookings ￼) but also relieves airline staff workload. It simplifies handling of changes or disruptions by having all order info in one place rather than scattered across PNRs and records. Moreover, having a persistent order history enables more effective re-marketing and personalized re-engagement (e.g. targeting a customer with relevant offers based on past trips) ￼.
	•	Faster Time to Market: Implementing new retail capabilities or even launching a new sales portal (for a specific market or segment) can be done in a fraction of the time compared to traditional solutions. Retailaer’s platform was built with “adaptability and agility” in mind ￼. Airlines can configure business rules, add ancillaries, or tweak the user interface without extensive coding. The typical deployment is much faster (in months) thanks to the system’s modularity and rich out-of-box features ￼. This speed means airlines can respond quickly to market opportunities, seasonal promotions, or competitive pressures with new offers and partnerships.

Client Success: Air Europa’s “You Decide” Retailing Journey

A prime example of Retailaer’s OMS in action is Air Europa, one of Retailaer’s early adopters and reference clients. Air Europa partnered with Retailaer to modernize its distribution as part of the airline’s NDC (New Distribution Capability) program and strategy to give customers and partners more choice in how they book. In 2025, Air Europa launched Retailaer’s platform in Spain for a select group of partners, with plans for a global rollout by year’s end ￼. This deployment included “Air Europa Direct” – a travel agency booking portal – and “Air Europa Go” – a corporate self-booking tool, both powered by Retailaer’s Offer/Order platform ￼.

The results have been transformative. Travel agents using Air Europa’s Retailaer-powered portal now have a “seamless shopping and servicing experience that integrates flights, ancillaries, and third-party services” all in one place ￼. Rather than juggling between systems, agents can book complex travel itineraries (with add-ons like bags or insurance) and service bookings post-ticketing within the same interface. This not only improves efficiency but also ensures agents can offer travelers more personalized, bundled options (aligning with Air Europa’s retail vision).

Yago Casasnovas, Head of Payments, Fraud Prevention and Distribution at Air Europa, praised the platform’s impact on their distribution strategy: “We are very pleased to have Retailaer’s platform in place to connect with our content to further extend our NDC journey, and [enhance] the relationship with our partners around the world” ￼. By enabling content access via multiple channels – the dedicated agency portal, NDC API connections, or even GDS – Air Europa is living up to its campaign slogan “You decide”, giving the user (or agent) the choice in how to access offers ￼. “The possibility of accessing our content via our Travel Agency portal, NDC or GDS makes shopping with Air Europa easier than ever,” Casasnovas explains ￼. This channel-agnostic approach was made possible by Retailaer’s OMS, which serves as the single source of offers and orders feeding all those channels.

From Retailaer’s perspective, the Air Europa project showcases the power of a third-gen retailing platform to unlock new value. “Air Europa’s adoption of the Connect platform demonstrates how airlines can unlock new value for [their] agency network without being constrained by legacy infrastructure,” says Anders Lofgren, Retailaer’s Co-founder and CEO ￼. By removing those legacy constraints, Air Europa can rapidly roll out new products or partnerships to travel agents globally, improving competitiveness. Lofgren adds that this exemplifies Retailaer’s core belief that “the future of airline retailing lies in adaptability, agility, speed to market and true partner enablement” ￼. In other words, the platform is built to enable airlines like Air Europa to be as nimble and customer-centric as the leading online retailers.

The partnership with Air Europa also underlines Retailaer’s open ecosystem approach. Retailaer’s platform in this case integrated with external solutions such as PROS’s group sales tool and the IATA Financial Gateway for payments, showing that the OMS can co-exist and enhance an airline’s existing tech stack ￼. This modular integration capability was crucial for Air Europa to implement a solution that worked with their specific needs (like group booking optimization) and existing processes.

Overall, Air Europa’s successful OMS implementation stands as a case study in modern airline retailing: it demonstrates how a third-generation eCommerce platform can increase speed and personalization in distribution. The airline can now offer a “more efficient, relevant, and connected retail experience” to its trade partners and customers ￼, which is driving both improved user satisfaction and business performance.

Founder’s Vision and Market Positioning

Retailaer’s vision for its OMS platform is deeply informed by founder Anders Lofgren’s decades of airline retail experience ￼. Lofgren emphasizes that airlines must understand the evolution from legacy eCommerce to Offer/Order Management to meet modern customer expectations ￼. Not every airline will immediately leap to the latest technology, he notes, but it’s crucial to “understand their options and the reasons for choosing a specific technology” in the context of their goals ￼. This pragmatic approach underpins Retailaer’s product positioning as a “third-generation” solution – one that airlines can adopt when they are ready to truly become digital retailers rather than just ticket sellers.

According to Lofgren, an Offer/Order Management System provides capabilities that legacy eCommerce setups simply cannot. It “provides airline retailers with a centralised hub for managing offers and orders across channels,” connecting with both airline internal systems and external partners so that customers can purchase products efficiently and accurately across all channels ￼. By separating the commercial retail layer from the operational PSS, the OMS “opens doors for airlines to capitalise on revenue otherwise not accessible” under the old PSS-centric model ￼. For instance, airlines can easily sell non-flight content or create new bundled offerings without being limited by what the PSS can store in a PNR. This decoupling also means the airline can maintain a far richer dataset of customer orders (beyond the life of a PNR) – essentially building its own “retail CRM” of travel purchases to enable personalization and targeted re-marketing ￼.

From a marketing standpoint, Retailaer positions its platform as a way for airlines to finally behave like true omnichannel retailers. The language used is about customer-centricity, relevance, and control. Airlines are encouraged to “say goodbye to generic offers [and] hello to relevant offers in every channel,” making each customer feel recognized and valued ￼. The platform is often described as a “Modern Airline Retailing” solution or the “Modern Distribution Platform”, highlighting that it brings retail best practices (dynamic pricing, inventory bundling, customer personalization, quick time-to-market) into the airline industry ￼. By using Retailaer, an airline can claim to offer a next-gen shopping experience akin to leading e-commerce brands – for example, an “Amazon-like” seamless shopping and self-service across devices, but tailored to travel.

Importantly, Retailaer’s messaging also stresses partnership and ecosystem. The term “true partner enablement” in Lofgren’s quote speaks to how the OMS not only benefits the airline’s direct sales, but also empowers its partners (travel agencies, corporates, tourism partners) through modern connectivity ￼. In practice, this means airlines deploying Retailaer can strengthen their B2B relationships by providing travel agents or corporate clients with better tools (as seen with Air Europa’s agency and corporate portals). It’s a win-win: the airline grows sales in controlled channels, and partners get improved content access and ease of doing business.

Lastly, the “third-generation” label signifies that Retailaer’s product is future-proof and aligned with industry modernization efforts. It supports the latest standards like NDC and ONE Order (IATA’s vision for order-based retailing), ensuring that airlines won’t be left behind as the industry shifts to offers and orders. In summary, Retailaer’s OMS is marketed as “the Modern Airline Distribution and Retailing Platform” that gives airlines everything they need in one spot – a unified view of the customer and full control over retailing ￼. With this platform, an airline can “take retailing to new heights” by embracing a customer-first approach and leaving behind the constraints of earlier-generation systems ￼.

In the words of Anders Lofgren, Retailaer’s co-founder, “we believe the future of airline retailing lies in adaptability, agility, speed to market and true partner enablement” ￼. Retailaer’s third-generation Offer & Order Management solution is built precisely on those principles – enabling airlines and travel brands to innovate and thrive in the era of modern, customer-centric commerce.
