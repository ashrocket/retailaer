## Travel Distribution Is Needlessly Complicated — And It’s Holding the Industry Back

I’m not an “industry expert” in the credentialed sense — but I’ve spent enough time inside hotel and airline distribution to see how *needlessly* complex it has become, and how often that complexity actively destroys value.

When I worked for one of the largest room sellers in Southeast Asia, I learned something that never quite left me:

We would sometimes **lose money on a hotel room by design**.

Not because demand was weak — but because:
- We needed to hit a **quota** with one wholesaler to protect our contracted rates  
- We were buying the same room back at a **markup** from another partner  
- Then discounting it **below market** just to satisfy a different contractual obligation  

On paper, it all “made sense.”  
In reality, it was circular arbitrage in service of distribution politics.

And that was hotels.

## Hotel Distribution: A Maze of Incentives, Not Value

Modern hotel distribution isn’t really about rooms — it’s about *channel management*:

- Direct booking channels  
- OTAs  
- Wholesalers  
- GDS pipes originally built for travel agents  
- Rate parity clauses and quiet exceptions  

Each layer has its own economics. Each partner wants volume, protection, and margin. The result is a system where **pricing decisions are often driven more by contractual gravity than consumer demand**.

Academic and industry research backs this up:
- Wholesale distribution creates opacity and margin leakage  
- OTA dependency constrains pricing flexibility  
- Hotels routinely trade yield for visibility  

Which explains why you can end up discounting a room *you could have sold directly* — simply to keep peace across the channel ecosystem.

## Airline Revenue Management: Elegance Buried Under Bureaucracy

Airline revenue management *should* be elegant.

At its heart, it’s about one thing:  
> **Availability is the lever.**

Who gets which seat, at what price, under which conditions.

But decades of layering have turned that elegance into something else entirely:

- Fare classes  
- Fare families  
- 90+ restriction categories  
- Point-of-sale rules  
- Origin/destination logic  
- Interline and codeshare constraints  
- Data brokers and processors taking a cut at every step  

Each layer is supported by a vendor.  
Each vendor takes a slice.  
Each “standard” adds inertia.

Which is why the most valuable thing ITA Software ever built wasn’t flight search — it was **revenue management and availability optimization**.

And why it’s still astonishing that, after Google acquired ITA, that same class of software was later offered to airlines for *a rounding error* compared to what Google paid.

## The Industry’s Favorite Mistake: Waiting for Standards to Save It

Airlines and hotels keep hoping for an industry-wide rescue:

- New distribution standards  
- Harmonized schemas  
- Another working group  
- Another round of consensus-driven negotiation  

It resembles the browser wars of the late 1990s — except this time, the industry *chose* fragmentation and then tried to standardize its way out of it.

The problem is simple:
> **Standards don’t fix incentives.**

And in travel, incentives are the real problem.

## The Way Out Is Owning the Sell

The uncomfortable truth:

- No standards body will rescue airline retailing  
- OTAs will not voluntarily simplify hotel distribution  
- Legacy intermediaries will not dismantle systems that pay them  

So airlines and hotels need to do something harder — but more honest:

**Sell what you control. On platforms you own. With offers you define.**

Simplify offers. Reduce artificial fare fences. Control availability directly. Treat distribution as a product, not a treaty.

Complexity is not sophistication.  
And in travel, it’s long past time to tell the difference.
