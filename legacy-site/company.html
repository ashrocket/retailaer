                <h3>Reimagining Modern Airline Distribution</h3>
                <p>We began our journey with an airline and a group of dedicated individuals who recognised that the current eCommerce platforms didn't meet our expectations of modern airline retailing. <br><br>That's when we embarked on the mission to create a modern airline distribution platform, drawing inspiration from the retail industry, architecting around the Customer instead of PNRs and Orders. Our collective drive is to craft exceptional customer experiences in the travel sector</p>

                <h3>Modern Airline Retailing Made Simple</h3>
                <p>We pinpointed four crucial areas necessary for successful airline retailing. <br>Consequently, we developed innovative solutions to free you up to concentrate on your retailing strategies.</p>
                <div class="about">
                    <div class="about-i">
                        <span class="icons icon-apps"></span>
                        <h5>Customers</h5>
                        <p>To make sure airlines can offer what their customers really need, we believe it's crucial to know those customers inside out. That's why we've put a big emphasis on integrating customer data and building a customer-first environment. We think this will help overcome the limitations of PNR and Order-centric approaches.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about-i">
                        <span class="icons icon-order"></span>
                        <h5>Offers & Orders</h5>
                        <p>Increase your distribution flexibility and start building incremental revenues with consistent offers and orders. Creating dynamic and relevant offers and bundles with a combination of products is just as essential as being able to create orders to keep track of its delivery. </p>

                    <div class="about-i">

                        <h5>Integrations</h5>
                        <p>Retailing wouldn't work without content, products, services, and customer data. That's why we integrate all types of content and manage your connections to ensure that your products and your partners' products are always accessible.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about-i">
                        <span class="icons icon-payments"></span>
                        <h5>Payments</h5>
                        <p>Payments are essential for making profits, and that's why we've put in a lot of effort to make sure that you always have control over payments and the ability to conduct retail transactions seamlessly. You have to be able to offer the right payment option in order to retail.</p>
